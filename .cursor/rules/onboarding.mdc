## Project Onboarding Guidelines

### Initial Project Analysis:
1. **Explore project structure** - Use directory listing to understand organization
2. **Identify key directories** - Focus on src/, docs/, tests/, config files
3. **Analyze core modules** - Examine main source code files and components
4. **Review documentation** - Read README, setup guides, and contribution docs
5. **Determine tech stack** - Identify languages, frameworks, and tools used

### Core Analysis Steps:
- **Programming languages & frameworks** - What technologies are used?
- **Project architecture** - How is the code organized?
- **Key contributors** - Who are the main developers and their focus areas?
- **Recent development** - What features are being actively worked on?
- **Complex areas** - Which parts of the codebase are most challenging?

### Development Environment Setup:
- **Dependencies** - What packages/libraries are required?
- **Build process** - How to compile/run the project?
- **Testing** - What testing frameworks and how to run tests?
- **Development workflow** - Git flow, code review process, deployment

### Key Questions for New Developers:
1. What is the project's main purpose and target users?
2. What are the core business domains/features?
3. How is the codebase organized (architecture patterns)?
4. What are the most complex/critical modules?
5. What development tools and workflows are used?
6. How to set up the local development environment?
7. What are the testing and quality assurance practices?

### Helpful Resources to Find:
- Project documentation and architecture docs
- API documentation and integration guides
- Issue trackers and project boards
- Team communication channels
- Code review guidelines and standards

### Next Steps for New Developers:
1. Set up development environment following setup instructions
2. Read through core module documentation
3. Run existing tests to ensure environment works
4. Start with small tasks or bug fixes to learn codebase
5. Ask questions about unclear areas and complex modules

**TIP:** When analyzing a project, focus on understanding the "why" behind architectural decisions, not just the "what" of the code.
