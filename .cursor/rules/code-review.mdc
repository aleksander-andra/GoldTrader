## Code Review Guidelines

### Review Priorities (in order):
1. **Logic errors and bugs** that may cause system crashes
2. **Security vulnerabilities** and data protection issues
3. **Performance problems** that impact user experience
4. **Maintainability issues** that increase technical debt
5. **Code style and consistency** with project standards

### Review Process:
- Analyze code for business logic correctness
- Check error handling and edge case coverage
- Verify proper validation and sanitization of inputs
- Evaluate impact on existing functionality
- Assess test coverage and quality

**IMPORTANT:** Only report significant issues that require action. Provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions.
